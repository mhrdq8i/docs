# Database Normalization

Database Normalization is a process of organizing database tables to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity. Let me explain the key concepts and normal forms:

### First Normal Form (1NF)

- Each table cell should contain a single value (atomic)
- Each record needs to be unique
- Each column should have a single type of data

### Second Normal Form (2NF)

- Must satisfy 1NF
- All non-key attributes must fully depend on the primary key
- No partial dependencies allowed

### Third Normal Form (3NF)

- Must satisfy 2NF
- No transitive dependencies between non-key attributes
- Every non-key attribute should depend only on the primary key

### Examples

#### Before normalization

```sql
Customer_Orders
ID | Customer_Name | Customer_Address | Order_Date | Product | Category | Price
```

#### After normalization

```sql
Customers
Customer_ID | Name | Address

Products
Product_ID | Name | Category | Price

Orders
Order_ID | Customer_ID | Product_ID | Order_Date
```

### Benefits of normalization

- Reduces data redundancy - information is stored only once
- Ensures data consistency - updates affect only one record
- Makes the database more flexible for future changes
- Improves query performance in many cases

### However, there are times when denormalization might be preferred

- When read performance is more critical than write performance
- In data warehousing scenarios
- When the data structure is relatively stable and won't change often
