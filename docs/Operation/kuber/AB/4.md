# 04. Node Selectors

## Node Selector

[nodeSelector] is the simplest recommended form of node selection constraint.

## Node Labels

Like many other Kubernetes objects, [nodes] have `labels`. You can `attach labels manually`. Kubernetes also populates a [standard] set of labels on all nodes in a cluster.

## Node Affinity

[Node affinity] is conceptually similar to `nodeSelector`, allowing you to constrain which nodes your Pod can be scheduled on based on node labels.

More precisely "Node Affinity" the more complete than "Node Selector". It gets more filters and conditions to you.

### Node Affinity Type

#### Available

- **required DuringScheduling Ignored DuringExecution:**  The scheduler can't schedule the Pod unless the rule is met. This functions like `nodeSelector`, but with a more expressive syntax.
- **preferred DuringScheduling Ignored DuringExecution:** The scheduler tries to find a node that meets the rule. If a matching node is not available, the scheduler still schedules the Pod.

#### Planned

- available in future version

|   | DuringScheduling | DuringExecution |
| - | - | - |
| Type 1 | Required  | Ignore   |
| Type 1 | Preferred | Ignore   |
| Type 1 | Required  | Required |

### Node Affinity + Taint/Tolerance

- **The only way** that you assign specific pods to specific node, is a combine "Node Affinity" + "Taint/Tolerance"

## Resource Management for Pods and Containers

### Resource requests and limits of Pod and container

For each container, you can specify [resource limits] and requests, including the following:

```shell
    spec.containers[].resources.limits.cpu
    spec.containers[].resources.limits.memory
    spec.containers[].resources.limits.hugepages-<size>
    spec.containers[].resources.requests.cpu
    spec.containers[].resources.requests.memory
    spec.containers[].resources.requests.hugepages-<size>
```

### Resource units in Kubernetes

#### [Resource units]

- [CPU resource units]
- [Memory resource units]

### Container resources

An [example]

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: images.my-company.example/app:v4
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "64Mi"
        cpu: "250m"
      limits:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
  - name: log-aggregator
    image: images.my-company.example/log-aggregator:v6
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "64Mi"
        cpu: "250m"
      limits:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
```

## DaemonSet

A [DaemonSet] ensures that all (or some) Nodes run a copy of a Pod.
***Exactly one*** instance of every pod.

## Static Pods

[Static Pods] are managed directly by the kubelet daemon on a specific node, without the API server observing them.

- Have a quick review of [kubelet] workload
- Have a quick review of [schedular] workload
- Have a quick review of [controller] workload

## Configure Multiple Schedulers

[Multiple Schedulers]

## Monitoring, Logging, and Debugging

### [Debugging]

[**cAdvisor**]: Daemon for collecting, aggregating and exposing container metrics included in Kubelet.

- kubernetes can expose logs via event
- kubernetes shows container logs, if you have more than one container you should enter container name

## Application Lifecycle Management

Application [Lifecycle] Management

- Rolling Update, Rolling Back
- Configure Applications
  - Configuring Command and Arguments in Application
  - Configure Environment Variables
  - Configure ConfigMap and Secret

- Multi Container PODs
  - Multi Container PODs and POD Design-Pattern
  - InitContainer

- Self Healing Application
