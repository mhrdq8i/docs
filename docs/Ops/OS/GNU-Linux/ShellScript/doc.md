## Bash Comparisons

### Numeric Comparisons

| Comparison | Description |
| - | - |
| n1 -eq n2 | Check if n1 is equal to n2 |
| n1 -ge n2 | Check if n1 is greater than or equal to n2 |
| n1 -gt n2 | Check if n1 is greater than n2 |
| n1 -le n2 | Check if n1 is less than or equal to n2 |
| n1 -lt n2 | Check if n1 is less than n2 |
| n1 -ne n2 | Check if n1 is not equal to n2 |

### String Comparisons

| Comparison | Description |
| - | - |
| str1 = str2  | Check if str1 is the same as string str2 |
| str1 != str2 | Check if str1 is not the same as str2 |
| str1 < str2  | Check if str1 is less than str2 |
| str1 > str2  | Check if str1 is greater than str2 |
| -n str1      | Check if str1 has a length greater than zero |
| -z str1      | Check if str1 has a length of zero |

### The `test` Command File Comparisons

| Comparison | Description |
| - | - |
| [-d] file | Check if file exists and is a directory |
| [-e] file | Checks if file exists |
| [-f] file | Checks if file exists and is a file |
| [-s] file | Checks if file exists and is not empty |
| [-r] file | Checks if file exists and is readable |
| [-w] file | Checks if file exists and is writable |
| [-x] file | Checks if file exists and is executable |
| [-O] file | Checks if file exists and is owned by the current user |
| [-G] file | Checks if file exists and the default group is the same as the current user |
| file1 -nt file2 | Checks if file1 is newer than file2 |
| file1 -ot file2 | Checks if file1 is older than file2 |

## lsof

| Column |  Description |
| - | - |
| COMMAND | The first nine characters of the name of the command in the process |
| PID | The process ID of the process |
| USER | The login name of the user who owns the process |
| FD | The file descriptor number and access type (r - read, w - write, u - read/write) |
| TYPE | The type of file (CHR - character, BLK - block, DIR - directory, REG - regular file) |
| DEVICE | The device numbers (major and minor) of the device |
| SIZE | If available, the size of the file |
| NODE | The inode number of the local file |
| NAME | The name of the file |

### Example

```bash
lsof -a -p $$ -d 0,1,2

-a: means and conditions together
-p: lsof condition over the specific process
-d: select some file descriptor
```
