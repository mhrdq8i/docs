## Storage Providers

### Storage Controller

List of some useful storage controller

- [MetaController]
- [OperatorSDK]
- [Kudo]

### Prometheus High Availability

- [thanos]

### Object Storage

- [MinIO]

### Cloud Storage Providers

- [CloudProvider]

#### OpenStack

- [OpenStackCloud]

## Networks

- Cluster Networking
- POD Networking
- CNI in K8S
- Service Networking
- DNS in K8S
- Ingress

### Components Ports and Connections

[List of Kubernetes Components Ports]

### Pod Network

#### CNI Standards

- Each pod should have an IP address
- Each pod should be able to communicate with every pod in the same node
- Each pod should be able to communicate with every pod in the other nodes without NAT

### KubeProxy

KubeProxy use one of these three ways to handle traffic

- **userspace**: use kubeproxy as a linux service, in this scenario we have to install kubeproxy binary

- **iptables**: for lab envs and tiny production env

- **ipvs**: for clusters that has more than 10,000 services

## DNS

### Core DNS

[Core-DNS] is like a `/etc/hosts` by continuously update names and IPs.
