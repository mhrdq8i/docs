# PodMan

## What is difference between Podman and Docker?

Podman and Docker are both containerization tools used to create, manage, and run containers, but they have some key differences in their architecture, features, and use cases. Here's a breakdown of the main differences:

### 1. **Architecture**

- **Docker**:
  - Uses a client-server architecture.
  - The Docker CLI communicates with the Docker daemon (`dockerd`), which manages containers, images, networks, and volumes.
  - The daemon runs as a background process and requires root privileges by default.
- **Podman**:
  - Uses a daemonless architecture.
  - Podman directly interacts with the container runtime (e.g., `runc` or `crun`) without requiring a central daemon.
  - Runs containers as the current user by default, avoiding the need for root privileges.

### 2. **Root vs. Rootless**

- **Docker**:
  - By default, Docker requires root privileges to run containers, which can pose security risks.
  - Rootless mode is available but not as mature or widely adopted as Podman's rootless approach.
- **Podman**:
  - Designed to run containers as a non-root user by default, enhancing security.
  - Rootless containers are a core feature, making Podman more secure for multi-user environments.

### 3. **Orchestration**

- **Docker**:
  - Includes Docker Swarm for container orchestration.
  - Often used with Kubernetes, but Docker Swarm is its native orchestration tool.
- **Podman**:
  - Does not include built-in orchestration but integrates well with Kubernetes.
  - Offers `podman play kube` to run Kubernetes YAML files locally.
  - Can be used with external tools like Kubernetes or OpenShift for orchestration.

### 4. **Pods**

- **Docker**:
  - Does not natively support the concept of pods (groups of containers that share resources).
- **Podman**:
  - Supports pods, which are groups of containers that share the same network namespace, storage, and resources.
  - This makes Podman more aligned with Kubernetes, where pods are a fundamental concept.

### 5. **Compatibility**

- **Docker**:
  - Uses its own container image format and runtime.
  - Docker images are widely supported and can be used with other tools like Podman.
- **Podman**:
  - Fully compatible with Docker images and Dockerfiles.
  - Can be used as a drop-in replacement for Docker in many cases, as it supports the same CLI commands.

### 6. **Systemd Integration**

- **Docker**:
  - Requires additional configuration to integrate with systemd for managing containers as services.
- **Podman**:
  - Designed to work seamlessly with systemd.
  - Can generate systemd unit files for containers, making it easier to manage containers as services.

### 7. **Community and Ecosystem**

- **Docker**:
  - Has a larger, more mature ecosystem and community.
  - More third-party tools and integrations are available.
- **Podman**:
  - Growing in popularity, especially in Red Hat-based environments.
  - Part of the Red Hat ecosystem and widely used in OpenShift.

### 8. **Networking**

- **Docker**:
  - Uses its own networking stack (`docker0` bridge, etc.).
- **Podman**:
  - Uses CNI (Container Network Interface) for networking, which is the same standard used by Kubernetes.

### 9. **Storage**

- **Docker**:
  - Uses its own storage drivers (e.g., overlay2, aufs).
- **Podman**:
  - Uses `containers/storage` library, which supports multiple storage drivers and is more flexible.

### 10. **Licensing**

- **Docker**:
  - Docker Engine is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.
  - Some Docker tools and services are proprietary.
- **Podman**:
  - Fully open-source and licensed under the Apache License 2.0.
  - Developed and maintained by Red Hat.

### Summary Table

| Feature             | Docker                         | Podman                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Architecture        | Client-server with daemon      | Daemonless                   |
| Rootless Containers | Supported but less mature      | Default and mature           |
| Pods                | Not supported                  | Supported                    |
| Orchestration       | Docker Swarm, Kubernetes       | Kubernetes, external tools   |
| Systemd Integration | Requires configuration         | Native support               |
| Networking          | Docker-native                  | CNI-based                    |
| Storage             | Docker-native drivers          | `containers/storage` library |
| Licensing           | Open-source (some proprietary) | Fully open-source            |

### When to Use Which?

- **Use Docker** if:

  - You need a mature ecosystem with extensive third-party support.
  - You are already using Docker Swarm for orchestration.
  - You prefer a more established tool with a large community.

- **Use Podman** if:
  - You want a daemonless, rootless architecture for better security.
  - You are working in a Kubernetes or OpenShift environment.
  - You need native pod support or better systemd integration.

Both tools are powerful, and the choice depends on your specific use case and requirements.
