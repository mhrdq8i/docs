# 08 Release Engineering

## Recap

### Review

The key topics include the **role of release engineers**, the **principles guiding release engineering at Google**, tools like Rapid, Blaze/Bazel, Midas Package Manager (MPM), and Sisyphus. Also, there's a focus on philosophies like **self-service models**, **high velocity**, **hermetic builds**, and **policy enforcement**.

The role of **release engineers**, **core principles**, **tools and workflows**, **configuration management**, and **key takeaways**. The user might be looking for a concise summary that highlights how Google approaches release engineering, **emphasizing automation, scalability, and reliability**.

The four major principles: **self-service model**, **high velocity**, **hermetic builds**, and **enforcement of policies**. Also, mention the tools like Rapid, Blaze, MPM, and Sisyphus, explaining their roles in the release process. The deployment strategies like **canary deployments** and the use of **Sisyphus for rollouts** are important too.

The user might also be interested in the **collaboration between SREs and release engineers**, especially in **managing configurations** and ensuring **reliable releases**. The conclusion about starting release engineering early in the project lifecycle is a key takeaway.

Highlight the importance of **hermetic builds**, **automation**, and the **balance between velocity and reliability**.

### Definitions

### **1. Role of Release Engineers**

- **Purpose**: Ensure software is built, tested, packaged, and deployed **reliably, consistently, and automatically**.
- **Responsibilities**:
    - Define release processes and best practices.
    - Develop tools (e.g., **Rapid**, **Midas Package Manager**) for scalable, repeatable releases.
    - Collaborate with SREs and developers to align release practices with reliability goals.

### **2. Core Principles of Release Engineering**

1. **Self-Service Model**:

    - Teams own their release processes via automated tools (e.g., **Rapid**).
    - Enables high velocity with minimal manual intervention.

2. **High Velocity**:

    - Frequent releases (e.g., hourly builds) reduce delta between versions, easing testing and troubleshooting.
    - **"Push on Green"**: Deploy automatically when tests pass.

3. **Hermetic Builds**:

    - Builds are **isolated** from external dependencies (e.g., libraries, tools).
    - Ensures reproducibility: same code + same revision = identical binaries.
    - **Cherry-picking**: Fix bugs in production by rebuilding the original revision with specific changes.

4. **Policy Enforcement**:
    - Security via **access controls** (code reviews, gated operations).
    - Audit trails track changes (e.g., who approved a cherry-pick).

### **3. Tools & Workflow**

- **Blaze/Bazel**:

    - Google’s build tool for compiling code (C++, Java, Go, etc.).
    - Defines dependencies and build targets.

- **Rapid**:

    - Automates releases using **blueprints** (config files defining build, test, deployment rules).
    - Integrates with **Borg** for scalable execution.
    - Workflow:
        1. Create a release branch from the mainline.
        2. Compile code and run tests in parallel.
        3. Deploy via **canary** (small rollout) or full production push.\*\*\*\*

- **Midas Package Manager (MPM)**:

    - Packages binaries/configurations with unique hashes and labels (e.g., `canary`, `production`).
    - Labels auto-update to the latest version (e.g., deploying `canary` always fetches the newest labeled package).

- **Sisyphus**:
    - SRE-developed rollout framework for complex deployments (e.g., phased geographic rollouts).

### **4. Configuration Management**

Strategies to avoid instability:

1. **Mainline Configuration**:

    - Store configs in the main repository; decouples binary releases from config changes.
    - Risk: Skew between checked-in and running configs.

2. **Configs in MPM Packages**:

    - Bundle configs with binaries for simplicity.

3. **Configuration Packages**:

    - Snapshot configs alongside binaries using **build IDs**.
    - Enables independent updates (e.g., fix a flag without rebuilding the binary).

4. **External Stores**:
    - Dynamic configs stored in **Chubby**, **Bigtable**, or source-based filesystems.

### **5. Deployment Strategies**

- **Risk-Based Rollouts**:

    - **Canary**: Deploy to small clusters first.
    - **Exponential**: Rapid expansion for user-facing services.
    - **Multi-Day**: Gradual rollouts for critical infrastructure.

- **Rollback**:
    - Automated via **Sisyphus** or MPM labels (revert to a prior version).

### **6. Key Takeaways**

- **Automation ≠ Autonomy**: Tools like Rapid and Sisyphus reduce toil but require **human oversight** for edge cases.
- **Hermeticity is Critical**: Ensures builds are reproducible and auditable.
- **Start Early**: Integrate release engineering at the project’s start to avoid retrofitting.
- **Collaboration**: SREs, developers, and release engineers must align on policies and tools.

**Example Workflow**:
Code commit → Blaze build → Rapid tests → MPM packaging → Sisyphus rollout → Production.

This chapter underscores that **release engineering is foundational** to reliability, not an afterthought. By automating builds, enforcing policies, and decoupling configurations, Google ensures scalable, consistent releases while minimizing human error.
