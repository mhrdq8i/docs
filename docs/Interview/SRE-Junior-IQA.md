# ðŸŽ¯ Junior SRE Interview

**Questions** + **Answers**

## ðŸ”¹ Operating System & Linux

- What does the `top` command show?

  **Answer:** Running processes, CPU usage, memory usage, and load average.

- What is the difference between a `hard link` and a `soft link`?

  **Answer:**

  - A hard link points directly to the fileâ€™s inode;
  - A soft link (symlink) is a shortcut pointing to the file path.

- What is the purpose of the `/etc/hosts` file?

  **Answer:** Manual mapping of hostnames to IP addresses.

- Difference between `systemctl start` and `systemctl enable`?

  **Answer:**

  - `start` runs the service immediately;
  - `enable` makes it run automatically on boot.

- Difference between process and thread?

  **Answer:**

  - **Process** = independent program with its own memory space.
  - **Thread** = unit of execution inside a process sharing the same memory.

- Difference between `kill -9` and `kill -15`?

  **Answer:**

  - `-15` is a graceful termination signal (can be handled);
  - `-9` forces immediate kill (cannot be handled).

- What does `df -h` show?

  **Answer:** Disk usage, total, used, and available space on partitions.

- What is the difference between swap and RAM?

  **Answer:**

  - **RAM** is fast volatile memory;
  - **SWAP** uses disk as backup memory, much slower.

- Purpose of `/etc/resolv.conf`?

  **Answer:** Configures DNS servers used by the system.

## ðŸ”¹ Networking

- What does `ping` do?

  **Answer:** Sends `ICMP` packets to check reachability and latency.

- Difference between TCP and UDP?

  **Answer:**

  - TCP is connection-oriented and reliable;
  - UDP is connectionless and faster but unreliable.

- If DNS is not working but the network is fine, what do you check?

  **Answer:** Verify `/etc/resolv.conf`, test with `dig` or `nslookup`, check the DNS server.

- What is port 80 used for?

  **Answer:** HTTP.

- What is port 443 used for?

  **Answer:** HTTPS (HTTP over TLS).

- Difference between public IP and private IP?

  **Answer:**

  - Public IP is routable on the internet;
  - private IP is only used in local networks.

- What does NAT do?

  **Answer:** Translates private IP addresses to public IPs for internet access.

- If `ping` fails but `traceroute` shows a path, whatâ€™s the reason?

  **Answer:** `ICMP` may be blocked by a firewall.

- Difference between Layer 4 and Layer 7 load balancing?

  **Answer:**

  - **L4** â†’ based on IP/port (TCP/UDP).
  - **L7** â†’ based on application data (HTTP headers, paths).

## ðŸ”¹ Databases

- Difference between RDBMS and NoSQL?

  **Answer:**

  - **RDBMS** (MySQL, PostgreSQL) stores structured data with ACID compliance;
  - **NoSQL** (MongoDB, Cassandra) handles unstructured data, scales horizontally.

- What is database replication?

  **Answer:** Keeping identical copies of data across multiple servers for availability and redundancy.

- Difference between Backup and Snapshot?

  **Answer:**

  - **Backup** = copy of data stored elsewhere;
  - **Snapshot** = point-in-time copy of a system/disk (usually in the same environment).

## ðŸ”¹ Security

- Why is SSH key authentication better than passwords?

  **Answer:** Stronger security, prevents brute-force, easier for automation.

- Difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?

  **Answer:**

  - **Symmetric** â†’ same key for encryption/decryption (fast).
  - **Asymmetric** â†’ public/private keys (more secure, slower).

- Why is the Principle of Least Privilege important?

  **Answer:** Reduces risk by limiting user and service permissions.

## ðŸ”¹ Monitoring & Observability

- Difference between Metrics, Logs, and Traces?

  **Answer:**

  - **Metrics** â†’ numeric time-series data (CPU, latency)
  - **Logs** â†’ textual events
  - **Traces** â†’ request path across distributed systems

- Difference between an Alert and a Notification?

  **Answer:**

  - **Alert** is triggered when a condition is violated;
  - **Notification** is the delivery method to the team.

- Difference between Histogram and Gauge?

  **Answer:**

  - **Histogram** â†’ distribution of values in buckets;
  - **Gauge** â†’ current value of a metric.

- What is a Canary Release?

  **Answer:** Gradual rollout of a new version to a small subset of users to reduce risk.

## ðŸ”¹ CI/CD & DevOps

- Difference between Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment?

  **Answer:**

  - **CI** = automatically testing and building code.
  - **CD** = automatically deploying code to production.

- If a build fails in GitLab CI or Jenkins, whatâ€™s your first step?

  **Answer:** Check logs, identify the failing stage, rollback or apply a quick fix.

- What is Blue-Green Deployment?

  **Answer:** Having two environments (blue & green) and switching traffic between them for zero-downtime deployment.

## ðŸ”¹ Cloud & Infrastructure

- Difference between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS?

  **Answer:**

  - **IaaS** â†’ Infrastructure as a Service (VMs, storage).
  - **PaaS** â†’ Platform as a Service (Heroku, App Engine).
  - **SaaS** â†’ Software as a Service (Gmail, Slack).

- What is Auto Scaling?

  **Answer:** Automatically adjusts the number of instances based on workload.

- Difference between Region and Availability Zone?

  **Answer:**

  - **Region** = geographic area (e.g., Europe West).
  - **AZ** = independent datacenters within a region.

## ðŸ”¹ SRE Culture

- Difference between SLA, SLO, and SLI?

  **Answer:**

  - **SLA** â†’ agreement with customers
  - **SLO** â†’ internal service quality target
  - **SLI** â†’ numeric indicator (e.g., latency <200ms for 99% of requests)

- What is a Postmortem and why is it important?

  **Answer:** A report after an incident including timeline, root causes, and corrective actions; ensures learning and prevention.

- What is an Error Budget?

  **Answer:** Allowed amount of downtime/errors over a period, based on the SLO.

- What is Blameless Culture?

  **Answer:** Focusing on learning and fixing issues instead of blaming individuals.
