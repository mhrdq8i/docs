# 🎯 Questions and Answers for Junior SRE (Support-focused)

## 🔹 Basic OS and Networking Concepts

### What is the difference between a process and a thread?

- A process is a running program with its own memory and resources.
- A thread is an execution path inside a process that shares the process’s resources with other threads.

### What does it mean when a program in Linux becomes zombie or defunct, and what should be done?

- A zombie process means it has finished execution but its entry remains in the process table because the parent hasn’t collected the exit status.
- Solution: Usually solved by killing/restarting the parent (`kill -9 <parent_pid>`).

### What’s the difference between TCP and UDP and their use cases?

- TCP is connection-oriented, reliable, guarantees ordered delivery (used for web, email).
- UDP is connectionless, faster, less reliable (used for DNS, video streaming, online games).

### When a website doesn’t load in the browser, what troubleshooting steps would you take?

1. Check internet connectivity (`ping 8.8.8.8`)
2. Verify DNS resolution (`dig`, `nslookup`)
3. Check routing (`traceroute`)
4. Test port availability (`telnet <host> 80`, `curl -v`)
5. Review firewall or network policies

### What are the uses of `top`, `htop`, `netstat`, `ss`, `curl`, `ping`, `traceroute`?

- `top/htop` → Monitor CPU, memory, and processes
- `netstat/ss` → View network connections and ports
- `curl` → Test HTTP endpoints
- `ping` → Check IP reachability
- `traceroute` → Trace the route packets take

## 🔹 Services and Monitoring

### What is SRE, and how does it differ from DevOps or SysAdmin?

- SRE focuses on **reliability**, **availability**, and **performance** of services.
- SysAdmins manage servers and infrastructure.
- DevOps focuses on CI/CD and bridging development and operations.

### What’s the difference between monitoring and observability?

- Monitoring: Collecting and viewing metrics/logs (e.g., CPU usage, error rates).
- Observability: The ability to understand the internal state of a system based on its outputs (logs, metrics, traces).

### What are SLI, SLO, and SLA?

- **SLI (Service Level Indicator):** A measurable metric (e.g., percentage of successful requests).
- **SLO (Service Level Objective):** The target for SLI (e.g., 99.9% success rate).
- **SLA (Service Level Agreement):** A contractual commitment with customers, including penalties if targets aren’t met.

### What would you do if a service’s CPU or memory usage suddenly spikes?

1. Check resource usage (`top`, `htop`)
2. Identify heavy processes
3. Check logs for memory leaks or infinite loops
4. Apply limits using cgroups/Kubernetes resource limits
5. Scale the service if needed

### You see HTTP 500 errors in logs — how do you investigate?

1. Identify timestamps of the errors
2. Check dependencies (databases, external services)
3. Verify system resources
4. Test endpoint manually with `curl`
5. Review recent changes (deployments, configs)

## 🔹 Containers and Tools

### Do you have Docker experience? How does a container interact with the host OS?

- A container is an isolated process running on the host kernel.
- It uses namespaces (for isolation of processes, network, mounts, etc.) and cgroups (to limit resources).

### What’s the difference between an image and a container?

- **Image**: Immutable, read-only snapshot.
- **Container**: A running instance of an image with a writable layer.

### Do you know Kubernetes? What is a Pod, and what does CrashLoopBackOff mean?

- **Pod**: The smallest deployable unit in K8s (one or more containers).
- **CrashLoopBackOff**: The container repeatedly crashes and Kubernetes keeps restarting it, often due to misconfiguration, dependency failure, or code bugs.

## 🔹 Support and Incident Handling

### If you get an alert at 3 AM that a database is down, what’s your first action?

**A:**

1. Validate the alert
2. Check service status (`systemctl status`, `docker logs`, health checks)
3. Review system resources (CPU, RAM, disk)
4. Attempt quick restore (restart or failover)
5. Notify the team if escalation is required

### What’s the difference between issue, incident, problem, and outage?

- **Issue:** Any reported problem
- **Incident:** An event affecting service reliability
- **Problem:** Root cause behind one or more incidents
- **Outage:** Severe or complete service downtime

### Have you written a postmortem? What should it include?

- A postmortem analyzes an incident and should include:

  - Description of the event
  - Timeline
  - Impact on users
  - Root cause
  - Actions taken
  - Action items for prevention

### If you notice a critical service is having issues but no alert has fired, what would you do?

# 🎯 SRE Interview Questions with Answers (Mid-level+)

## 🖥️ OS & Performance

### What’s the difference between load average and CPU usage, and how do you interpret them?

- **CPU usage** shows the percentage of CPU time used.
- **Load average** shows the average number of processes waiting for CPU, disk, or I/O over 1, 5, and 15 minutes.
- High load with low CPU usage usually indicates I/O bottlenecks.

### How do you detect memory leaks in a service?

- Monitor memory usage over time (`top`, `htop`, Prometheus metrics).
- Use tools like `valgrind`, `pmap`, `gperftools`, or `heapdump` depending on the language.
- Check GC (garbage collection) logs in languages like Java/Python.

### What does high IOwait indicate, and how would you troubleshoot it?

- IOwait means CPU is idle but waiting for disk I/O.
- **Causes**: slow disks, too many concurrent requests, database contention.
- **Troubleshooting**: check `iostat`, `iotop`, disk latency, optimize queries, use faster storage (SSD/NVMe).

### Difference between vertical scaling and horizontal scaling?

- **Vertical:** Adding more resources (CPU/RAM) to a single machine. Easy but limited.
- **Horizontal:** Adding more machines/instances. More scalable, but adds complexity (load balancing, consistency).

## 🌐 Networking & Distributed Systems

### How does DNS caching work at different levels?

- **App-level cache** (e.g., browser cache).
- **OS resolver cache** (`nscd`, `systemd-resolved`).
- **Recursive resolver cache** (like 8.8.8.8).
- **Authoritative DNS** has TTL that controls cache duration.

### If latency increases between two microservices, how do you find the root cause?

- Check metrics (latency, error rate) from monitoring.
- Trace requests with distributed tracing (Jaeger, OpenTelemetry).
- Use network tools (`mtr`, `tcpdump`).
- Verify downstream dependencies (DB, API).

### What are circuit breaker and retry patterns, and why are they important?

- **Retry:** Automatically retry failed requests (with backoff).
- **Circuit breaker:** Stops sending requests when failure rate is high, allowing system to recover.
- Important in distributed systems to prevent cascading failures.

### Explain CAP theorem with examples

- **C (Consistency):** All nodes see the same data at the same time.
- **A (Availability):** Every request receives a response.
- **P (Partition tolerance):** System works despite network splits.
- **Example CP**: HBase, ZooKeeper.
- **Example AP**: Cassandra, DynamoDB.

## 📊 Observability & Monitoring

### Difference between metrics, logs, and traces?

- **Metrics:** Aggregated numerical data (CPU, QPS, latency).
- **Logs:** Event-based text records.
- **Traces:** Track requests across services (useful in microservices).

### What is cardinality in metrics, and why is it dangerous in Prometheus?

- **Cardinality** = number of unique label combinations.
- **High cardinality** (e.g., per-user metrics) causes high memory usage and slow queries.
- **Rule**: Avoid unbounded labels (like user IDs, request IDs).

### Difference between blackbox and whitebox monitoring?

- **Blackbox:** Tests from outside (ping, HTTP check). Focus on availability.
- **Whitebox:** Monitors internal metrics/logs. Focus on internal health.

### How do you deal with alert fatigue?

- Deduplicate and group alerts.
- Prioritize by severity and business impact.
- Use SLO-based alerting instead of raw metrics.
- Regularly review and tune alert rules.

## 🛠️ Containers / Kubernetes

### Difference between Deployment, StatefulSet, and DaemonSet in K8s?

- **Deployment:** Stateless workloads, easy scaling.
- **StatefulSet:** Stateful apps (DBs, Kafka), keeps identity & stable storage.
- **DaemonSet:** Ensures one pod runs on every node (e.g., logging/monitoring agents).

### Why might a Pod stay in Pending state?

- Not enough resources (CPU/RAM).
- Node selectors/affinity rules not satisfied.
- Missing PersistentVolume.
- Scheduler can’t place it due to taints/tolerations.

### When do you use HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler), and what are its limitations?

- **Use**: Auto-scale pods based on metrics (CPU, custom metrics).

- **Limitations**:
  - Scaling delay (reactive, not predictive).
  - Doesn’t handle queue-based workloads well.
  - Needs accurate metrics.

### What is the role of kube-proxy?

- Handles Service networking in K8s.
- Maintains iptables/IPVS rules for load balancing traffic to pods.

## ⚡ Incident Response & Reliability

### Scenario: primary DB is down, replicas are healthy. What do you do?

- Promote a replica to primary (manual or via failover tool like Patroni, Orchestrator).
- Redirect traffic to new primary.
- Investigate and fix the original primary before reintroducing it.

### What metrics are critical for DB monitoring?

- Connection count, query latency, slow queries.
- Replication lag.
- Buffer cache hit ratio.
- Disk I/O and locks.

### What are MTTR, MTTD, and MTBF, and why are they important?

- **MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery):** Avg time to recover from failure.
- **MTTD (Mean Time to Detect):** Avg time to detect a failure.
- **MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures):** Avg time between failures.
- They measure reliability and efficiency of incident response.

### If rollback isn’t possible during a critical outage, what fallback strategies exist?

- Feature flagging (disable problematic feature).
- Graceful degradation (disable non-critical services).
- Rate limiting or traffic shedding.
- Serving cached/stale data.

## 🧩 Automation & DevOps Practices

### What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and why is it important? and it's tools?

- Managing infra with code instead of manual config.
- **Benefits**: repeatability, version control, automation.
- **Tools**: Terraform, Ansible, Pulumi, CloudFormation.

### What are the stages of a CI/CD pipeline, and how do they relate to SRE?

- **Stages**: build → test → deploy → verify.
- **SRE ensures reliability**: automated rollbacks, monitoring after deploys, canary releases.

### What’s the difference between blue-green and canary deployment?

- **Blue-green:** Two environments, switch all traffic at once.
- **Canary:** Gradually shift traffic to new version, monitor errors, roll back if needed.

### What is chaos engineering, and why is it useful?

- **Definition**: Practice of intentionally injecting failures into systems.
- **Goal**: test resilience and validate recovery processes before real outages happen.

- Check for hidden bottlenecks (thread pools, DB indexes, GC pauses).
- Test with load replay (synthetic traffic).

## 🔄 Incident Response at Scale

### Imagine a global outage is caused by a bad config push. How do you manage the incident?

1. Declare incident and assign roles (commander, communicator, investigator).
2. Rollback config immediately.
3. Communicate status to stakeholders/customers.
4. Run postmortem: root cause, why rollback didn’t happen faster, fix processes.

### How do you balance speed of incident response with risk of making it worse?

- Use predefined runbooks for known failure modes.
- Prefer safe rollbacks before risky fixes.
- Separate mitigation (quick fix) from remediation (long-term fix).
