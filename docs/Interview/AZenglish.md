## Body Language Tips

### 1. Eye Contact

Maintaining good eye contact during an online interview is essential. Look directly at the
camera instead of the screen. This shows confidence and engagement, helping you establish a
connection with the interviewer.

### 2. Posture

Sit up straight and avoid slouching. A good posture conveys professionalism and attentiveness.
Keep your back straight and shoulders relaxed to project confidence and seriousness.

### 3. Gestures

Use natural hand gestures to emphasize points, but avoid excessive movements that can be
distracting. Keep your gestures within the frame of the camera to maintain a professional
appearance.

### 4. Facial Expressions

Show appropriate facial expressions to convey your enthusiasm and interest. Smile genuinely
when appropriate and ensure your expressions match the tone of the conversation.3

### 5. Voice and Tone

Speak clearly and at a moderate pace. Vary your tone to keep the conversation engaging and
show enthusiasm. Ensure your volume is appropriate and avoid monotone speech.

### 6. Appearance

Dress professionally from head to toe, even if you think only your upper half will be visible. This
not only helps you feel confident but also ensures you are prepared for any unexpected camera
angles.

### 7. Environment

Ensure your background is clean and free of distractions. A neutral background is best as it
helps the interviewer focus on you without any visual distractions.

### 8. Minimize Distractions

Silence your phone and avoid background noise. Inform household members or roommates
about your interview to minimize interruptions.

### 9. Be Punctual

Log in to the interview platform a few minutes early to ensure everything is working properly
and to show that you value the interviewer's time.4

### 10. Attentiveness

Listen carefully to the interviewer's questions and respond thoughtfully. Nod to show
understanding and engagement. Avoid interrupting the interviewer and be polite throughout
the conversation.
