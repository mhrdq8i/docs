# Concurrency

## Channel

To accomplish message-sending concurrency, Rust’s standard library provides an implementation of channels. A channel is a general programming concept by which data is sent from one thread to another.

You can imagine a channel in programming as being like a directional channel of water, such as a stream or a river. If you put something like a rubber duck into a river, it will travel downstream to the end of the waterway.

A channel has two halves: a **transmitter** and a **receiver**. The transmitter half is the upstream location where you put rubber ducks into the river, and the receiver half is where the rubber duck ends up downstream. One part of your code calls methods on the transmitter with the data you want to send, and another part checks the receiving end for arriving messages. A channel is said to be closed if either the transmitter or receiver half is dropped.

### mpsc::channel

`mpsc` stands for *multiple producer, single consumer*. In short, the way Rust’s standard library implements channels means a channel can have multiple *sending* ends that produce values but only one *receiving* end that consumes those values. Imagine multiple streams flowing together into one big river: everything sent down any of the streams will end up in one river at the end.
